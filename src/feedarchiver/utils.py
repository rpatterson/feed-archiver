    Fix broken defaults in the Python's `mimetypes` standard library module.

    https://bugs.python.org/issue1043134

    Unfortunately, the defaults in the `mimetypes` module are wrong; `application/xml`
    for example is associated with `.xsl`.  Also unfortunately, `**/mime.types` files
    are also often wrong; `audio/mpeg` for example is associated with `.mpga`, at least
    in Ubuntu's `/etc/mime.types`.  Since both are wrong in different ways, there's no
    avoiding manual intervention.

    For each given priority type, ensure that the extension is returned first.
    Internally, the `mimetypes` module relies on the order in which types are added to
    the registry to decide which extension/suffix is first and thus the default for a
    given MIME type.  As such, for each priority type we manually move the priority
    extension to the front of the list extensions are appended to when they're added.
    Also requires promoting any such types to `strict=True` types if they were
    originally registered as `strict=False`.

# - *do* quote (IOW, do *not* allow) "/"
# - do *not* quote (IOW, *do* allow) spaces and other special characters found not to

# So far, special characters have been checked in a Samba share as browsed in the
# Windows 10 explorer in order to determine which should be allowed/unquoted.  The `%`
# character works in this test bed but of course it *must* be quoted, otherwise quoting
# and unquoting would not be symmetrical.  A directory with a Unicode character was also
# tested against this environment and found to be working but it doesn't seem possible
# to get `urllib.parse.quote` to leave them unquoted.  Test files were generated in the
# Samba share from the Linux side using the following:
