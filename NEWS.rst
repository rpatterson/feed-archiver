Feedarchiver 1.0.0b10 (2023-03-15)
==================================

Features
--------

- Add support for a fallback link configurations that take effect if no other
  configurations link the enclosure.
- Address a Bandit warning about requests without timeouts.
- Write an ``./index.html`` file listing links to archived feeds.
- Rename the ``link-paths`` plugin system to a more accurate name, ``enclosures``.  Note
  that this requires an update to existing archive configurations using ``link-paths``
  plugins.
- Replace ``content`` term with more correct ``enclosure`` term.  Requires running the ``$
  feed-archiver relink`` sub-command to update existing archives.
- Avoid unintended sub-directories in link path plugin template paths, add support for
  quoting path separators in plugin configuration.
- Make a parsed version of the feed and item with richer data available to link path
  plugin configurations, e.g. dates and times.
- Provide access to regular expression symbolic group names in the ``template`` plugins
  format strings.
- Improve link plugin template usability by providing the ``basename`` via a
  ``pathlib.Path`` object and use that to improve the default enclosure link basename.


Bugfixes
--------

- Fix an error when backup feed XML is present in the archive.
- Filter out duplicate link paths returned from plugins.

  as if it's the first time archiving this feed.
- Cleanup ``pathlib.Path(...)`` objects in ``$ feed-archiver update`` output.


Feedarchiver 0.1.1b0 (2022-12-14)
